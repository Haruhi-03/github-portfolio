# github-portfolio

This is a responsive portfolio website built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that displays
my skills, experience and information about me. 

This project is still being polish and will keep getting improved the more I expand my web developing skill.
For now the website will update based on my recent projects, experience and skills.
